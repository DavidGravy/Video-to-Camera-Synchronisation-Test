# Video To Camera Synchronisation Test Patterns

This is a set of simple test patterns for testing the synchronisation of a video display to a camera. This is a common workflow for Virtual Production and broadcast. 

# The Methodology

The file contains two basic tests for testing synchronisation. A strobe test and a moving lines test. The video clip should be played back from a media server of your choice within a genlocked enviroment. You should record the video clip been presented on the video wall with your camera. Playback the videoclip to review whether the syncrhonisation is good or bad. 

## Strobe Tests

The video features two strobe tests, first a black and white, second a cyan and magenta. These present sequentially in and on off fashoion. 

To validate synchronisation playback the clip. If you are seeing whole frames of black, white, cyan, or magenta your sync is good. If you are seeing any bleeding of colours or gradients your sync is bad. 

## Adjust Sync
Use the tools on you camera or on your genlock geneator to offset the camera from the video system or vice versa.
